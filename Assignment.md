Create a Todo List React App that has the following:

- SingleTodo.jsx:
  - [ ] Represents a single Todo item
  - [ ] Has the prop todoName which is a string representing the name of the task
  - [ ] Renders a <div /> with the name of the todo item in it
  - EXTRA CREDIT 1: TODOS COMPLETED ON CLICK
    - [ ] If completed, that todo items name is crossed out
    - [ ] Has the state completed which is a boolean representing completion
    - [ ] On click, toggles whether or not that todo item is completed
  - App.jsx:
    - Renders a header with “Todo List” in it
      - Has the state todos which is an array of todo items
      - Maps over the todos array, rendering a <SingleTodo /> element for each
      - EXTRA CREDIT 2: Filter.jsx
      - Has three buttons, “All”, “Active”, and “Completed”
        - Clicking one of the three buttons will filter away any todos with a status that doesn’t match the filter
        - i.e. “All” shows everything, “Active” only shows incomplete, “Completed” only shows complete
          Note: You may need to add state to other parts of the app to get this to work - think about how data flows through the app
